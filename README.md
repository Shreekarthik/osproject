 The primary thing of this design is to develop a simulator that allows users to understand and visualize how different 
 CPU scheduling algorithms operate. By simulating these algorithms, users can gain perception into their performance characteristics, 
 similar as effectiveness and responsiveness. The design aims to produce an educational tool that can be
 used in academic settings or by individualities interested in computer knowledge concepts.
